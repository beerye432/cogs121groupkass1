HEURISTICS

1. Visibility of System Status - This is addressed with the automatic population of the chat box, the hover effects of links and icons, and the labeling of the sections at the top of the corresponding page.

2. Match between System and the Real World - This is addressed with our back button pointing to the left, the same as the direction you would go to flip back in a book.

3. User Control and Freedom - This is addressed with a back button on every page and the option to go back to the home page by clicking on the app title in the topbar.

4. Consistency and Standards - This is addressed with a typical top bar and easily-identifiable, basic buttons to navigate.

5. Error Prevention - This is addressed with a popup box confirming if you really want to log out and with adequate spacing between buttons to keep from accidentally pressing the button next to the one the user wants.

6. Recognition Rather than Recall - This is addressed with having a topbar on every page so that the user doesn't have to recall how to logout or to go back, and it is also addressed with having labels at the top of each page saying where the user is rather than the user having to recall which sport was chosen.

7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use - This is addressed with being able to click the app title in the topbar to go back to the home screen with the list of sports.

8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design - This is addressed with using icons to represent words (e.g., back, logout, sports) and the overall lack of text, keeping only what is most important and pleasing to the eye.

9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors
Delete a message from the chat
404 page

10. Help and Documentation - This is addressed with a Help page.
