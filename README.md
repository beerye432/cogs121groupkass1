COGS 121 Group K Assignment 1

TASKS

- Brian: Brian worked on the facilities' pages and json, incorporated Leaflet, added the character limit and error diagnosis popup, the 404 page, fixed routing to facilities, and formatted messages to look like a chatroom.

- Tim: Tim worked on the initial setup & skeleton, Twitter, Passport, Mongo history, merge conflicts, added routes to get facilities, and updated facility route to get data.

- Ellen: Ellen worked on all of the login page, topbar and its routing, logout popup box, hover effects for links, formatting for the 6 chat pages, overall functionality/design consistency of the app, and most of the readme/heuristics.

- Shuyu: Shuyu worked on the six sport chat pages (badminton, basketball, tennis, jogging, volleyball, frisbee), chatbox and three buttons for each sport chat page. Clicking on the button will direct the user to the corresponding facilities page (set routes to facilities).

- Jiaying: Jiaying did sports page skeleton & icons, help page skeleton, and added the character limit visibility for the chatbox.

- Everyone worked on responsiveness

HEURISTICS

1. Visibility of System Status - This is addressed with the automatic population of the chat box, the hover effects of links and icons, and the labeling of the sections at the top of the corresponding page.

2. Match between System and the Real World - This is addressed with our back button pointing to the left, the same as the direction you would go to flip back in a book.

3. User Control and Freedom - This is addressed with a back button on every page and the option to go back to the home page by clicking on the app title in the topbar.

4. Consistency and Standards - This is addressed with a typical top bar; easily-identifiable, basic buttons to navigate; and the positioning of the affirmative logout button on the right (in the logout confirmation popup).

5. Error Prevention - This is addressed with a popup box confirming if you really want to log out and with adequate spacing between buttons to keep from accidentally pressing the button next to the one the user wants.

6. Recognition Rather than Recall - This is addressed with having a topbar on every page so that the user doesn't have to recall how to logout or to go back; it is also addressed with having labels at the top of each page saying where the user is rather than the user having to recall which sport was chosen; and it is also addressed with the logout button in the logout confirmation popup as bright yellow color while the cancel button is gray.

7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use - This is addressed with being able to click the app title in the topbar to go back to the home screen with the list of sports.

8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design - This is addressed with using icons to represent words (e.g., back, logout, sports) and the overall lack of text, keeping only what is most important and pleasing to the eye.

9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors - This is addressed with having a pop-up message when users try to type more 140 characters in the chat box in the sport-chat page.

10. Help and Documentation - This is addressed with a Help page.
